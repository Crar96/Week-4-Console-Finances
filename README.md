# Week-4-Console-Finances

Description:

Challenge task analyzing financial information for a fictional company. This task involved creating Javascript functions to analyze a provided dataset of profit/loss margins for different months over a period of time. The task was to write Javascript functions to analyze the data and console log the following information:

. The total number of months included in the dataset.

. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

. The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

. The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

I have included these instructions in the JS file as comments.

I made use of the "for" and "For if" loops to analyze the data and extract the values that I was looking for.
